# AI Full-Stack Developer Roadmap

This is my personal roadmap to transition from a C#/.NET/Power Platform developer to an AI Architect.

## Phase 0: Python for AI/ML + Architecture Foundations

### Project: CSV Data Analyzer

A simple Python script that reads a CSV file and prints average sales, total records, and highest sale.

### Business Impact
Automate manual reporting tasks to eliminate manual work.

### Files Included
- `csv-analyzer.py`: The main script
- `sample-data.csv`: Sample input data
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies

### How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-fullstack-roadmap.git
